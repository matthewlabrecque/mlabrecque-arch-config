# Arch Linux Autoconfig Setup
A auto-configuration utility used to create an opinionated system designed for development applications, built off vanilla Arch Linux.

## Installation
To run the utility, do the following
```sh
git clone https://codeberg.org/mhlab/arch-autoconfig.git ~/Downloads/ArchAutoconfig
cd ~/Downloads/ArchAutoconfig
./auto-config.sh
```
## Notes
This script is designed for Arch Linux systems running KDE. While I expect this system to work just fine on other desktop environments (such as GNOME) several pieces of software installed by this script are made by the KDE Project, so I would highly recommend looking through the app files to see if there's anything you do not want installed on this system.
## Who is this script best for?
If you are a developer who wants the latest apps/tools provided by a powerful package manager such as Arch, without the headache of manually installing/configuring a Arch system, then this script is perfect for you.
